Wagyu Key Gen is a GUI application providing functionality to the [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli). It is a React app running in Electron.  See `src/electron/` for the simple electron app and `src/react/` for where the magic happens.

## Environment Configuration & Dependencies
Prior to running Wagyu Key Gen a few dependencies need to be installed.

### Ubuntu 20.04 and later
Execute all those commands in your terminal to setup your dev environment.

```console
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt install -y build-essential nodejs git python3-distutils python3-dev

pip3 install pyinstaller

sudo npm install -g yarn

git clone https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu-key-gen
cd wagyu-key-gen

yarn install
yarn buildcli
```

### Ubuntu 18.04
Even if Ubuntu 18.04 is somewhat old, it is a great OS to build our releases on for the Linux target because it has an older GLIBC which makes it more compatible. More details [here](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#making-gnu-linux-apps-forward-compatible).

Execute all those commands in your terminal to build a distribution for release.
```console
